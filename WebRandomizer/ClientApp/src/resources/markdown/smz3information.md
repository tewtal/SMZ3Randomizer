# Randomizer Information

## What is this randomizer
The Super Metroid and A Link to the Past Crossover Randomizer is an item randomizer that combines Super Metroid and A Link to the Past into one experience and shuffles all the items and spreads the out in random locations in any of the games.  
Travel between the games is possible through the use of four cross-game portals spread out in the games in certain doors and entrances.

The game starts out in Super Metroid right after Samus' ship has landed on Zebes, and from this point there's the option to head further down into Super Metroid, or head to the first available cross-game portal.  
This portal is found in the door that normally would head to the Cratera Map Station, but this will instead take you outside the fortune teller's house south of Link's house in Hyrule.

These are the four cross-game portals in the game:
* Lake Hylia Fortune Teller ⇔ Crateria Map Room
* Back of Old Man Cave ⇔ Norfair Map Room
* Dark World Ice Rod Right ⇔ Maridia Missile Refill
* Misery Mire Right Shed ⇔ Golden Torizo Energy Refill

The goal is to defeat both Mother Brain in Super Metroid and Ganon in A Link to the Past, and after defeating the second final boss it is possible to end the game and reach the credits.
After defeating the first final boss you will still retain access to the game where you killed the boss, in case there are some items left to be found to complete the other game.

Being familiar with the regular [A Link to the Past Randomizer](https://alttpr.com/) and [Super Metroid Randomizer](https://sm.samus.link/) is a great benefit for playing this randomizer.

## Quick guide to getting started
To create a new randomized game, head over to the [Generate Randomizer Game](/configure/smz3) page.

1. Select the options you want to use for the game, and then press **Generate Game** to generate a new game.
2. After doing so you will be redirected to the "permalink" page where you need to select your original Super Metroid and A Link to the Past (Japanese 1.0) ROM's to continue.
3. There's also a few extra customization settings that can be done here such as changing the sprites of Samus and Link as well as some other options.
4. When you're happy with the options, hit *Download ROM* and you'll get a new ROM that you can play with an emulator or SD2SNES.

If you didn't select the *Race ROM* option, there will also be a *Playthrough* section that will list the items and their locations in case you get stuck and need some hints.

## Game generation options
These options are available when generating a new game.

### Super Metroid Logic
This option selects what kind of logic to use for item placement inside Super Metroid.
* Normal - Normal logic includes only what Super Metroid teaches players itself. Anything that's not demonstrated in-game or by the intro cutscenes will not be required here.
  
  Required moves include for example:
    * Wall jumping (not including very precise ones)
    * Shinesparks in any direction (short charging for these is not expected)
    * Infinite Bomb Jumps
* Hard - Hard logic is based upon the "no major glitches" ruleset and includes most tricks that are considered minor glitches, with some restrictions.
  You'll want to be somewhat of a Super Metroid veteran for this logic.
  
  Required moves include (in addition to anything in Normal logic) for example:
    * Mockballs
    * Short charging
    * Suitless underwater navigation
    * Continuous wall jumps
    * Forced heat damage
    * Advanced damage boosting
    * Clipping through certain blocks using enemies
    * and more...

### Goal
This option currently only has the *Defeat Ganon and Mother Brain* option, but will be expanded in the future to include other goals.

### First Sword
This option decides where the first sword will be placed.
* Randomized - The sword can be placed anywhere.
* Early - The sword will be placed in a location accessible from the start of the game.
* Unce assured - The sword will always be placed on Link's Uncle.

### Morph Ball
This option decides where the morph ball will be placed.
* Randomized - The morph ball can be placed anywhere.
* Early - The morph ball will be placed in a location accessible from the start of the game.
* Original location - The morph ball will always be placed at its original location.

### Seed
If you want to enter a custom number to be used as the random seed you can do so here, or leave it blank to have a random one picked for you.  
Numbers between 0 and 2147483647 are valid.

### Race ROM
Enabling the Race ROM option will generate your game without access to any spoiler log.

### Game Mode
Picks the game mode you want:
* Single player - Regular single player game
* Multiworld - Creates a co-op multiplayer multiworld session and requires additional entry of player count and player names.


## Customization Options
These options are entered after game generation and are cosmetic or non gameplay-altering options only.

### Play as
This lets you select the sprite to use for Link and Samus.
For Samus there is a toggle for how you want the Screw Attack animation to look when you don't have Space Jump equipped. 
If it is unchecked, the Screw Attack animation will always include the Space Jump animation as well (as in the original game), but if it's checked you will get the Screw Attack animation applied on top of the regular spin jump animation.

### Heart Beep
Sets the speed of the heart beep sound in A Link to the Past.

### Heart Color
Changes the color of the hearts in the HUD for A Link to the Past.

### Energy Beep
Toggles the low health energy beep in Super Metroid.
